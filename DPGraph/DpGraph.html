	<p>The world's most powerful software for math and physics
	visualization. Create beautiful, interactive, dynamic, photorealistic
	2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D and 8D graphs. So easy to use that even junior
	high and senior high students have had their graphs published.
	Includes hundreds of examples contributed by users from around the
	world.</p></a>

	<p>Over two million mathematicians, physicists, teachers and students
	at over 1,000 colleges, universities and K-12 schools worldwide are
	already licensed.</p>

	<p>Optimized for the internet -- search for DPGraph using your
	favorite search engine to find ways that people are using DPGraph for
	both classroom and distance learning. Used for pre-algebra, geometry,
	trigonometry and general physics, through multivariable calculus,
	field theory, quantum mechanics and gravitation.</p>
	
	<p>Use time and color as extra dimensions (to create motion or encode
	momentum, for example). Use the scrollbar to vary parameters in
	realtime, to slice through graphs, or to vary transparency. Programmed
	entirely in assembly language for maximum speed.</p>

	<p>Graph functions, equations, conic sections, planes, spheres,
	toruses, parametric curves and surfaces, implicit equalities and
	inequalities, volume intersections, volumes of integration, vector
	fields, surfaces of revolution, equipotential surfaces, and much more,
	in rectangular, polar, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates.</p>

		<p><strong>COMMON ERRORS:</strong> The seven most common mistakes when
		creating graphs in the EDIT dialog box are:
		<ol>
		<li>leaving out asterisks for multiplication;</li>
		<li>Leaving out equals signs or inequality signs;</li>
		<li>Leaving out the parentheses for lists;</li>
		<li>Trying to use equalities in intersections (DPGraph can only
		intersect inequalities, i.e. regions of space);</li>
		<li>Putting a space inside the two-character symbols :=, >=, or &lt;=;</li>
		<li>Using the parametric variables u or v in implicit graphs;</li>
		<li>Using the implicit variables x, y, z, r, theta, rho, or phi in
		parametric graphs.</li>
		</ol>
	
	<p><strong>Wrong:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>graph3d( 3x = z^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( x^2+y^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( x=1, y=1 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( x=1 & y=1 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( z^2> =x^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( z=u^2+v^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( rectangular(x,y,sin(x+y)) )</li>
	</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Right:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>graph3d( 3*x = z^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( z = x^2+y^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( ( x=1, y=1 ) )</li>
		<li>graph3d( x>1 & y>=1 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( z^2 >= x^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( z=x^2+y^2 )</li>
		<li>graph3d( rectangular(u,v,sin(u+v)) )</li>
	</ul>
	
		<p><strong>INEQUALITIES</strong>: When graphing an inequality, such as
		<strong>GRAPH3D</strong>( X>1 ), remember that "blue is true"; the
		bluest side of the graph is the region of space for which the
		inequality is true, the reddest side of the graph is the region of
		space for which the inequality is false. If the inequality is true for
		the surface itself, as in <strong>GRAPH3D</strong>( X>=1 ), then the
		bluest side is pure blue; if the inequality is false for the surface
		itself, as in <strong>GRAPH3D</strong>( X>1 ), then the reddest side
		is pure red.</p>

		<p><strong>DEFAULTS.DPG</strong>: With experience you may find the
		following technique useful when exploring a new surface. OPEN the file
		<strong>DEFAULTS.DPG</strong>, go to <strong>EDIT</strong>, modify the
		default equation, and then <strong>EXECUTE</strong>. Since all of the
		options are already in DEFAULTS.DPG they can be changed with very
		little typing. If you like, SAVE the modified file under a different
		name and it will be ready for future viewing and adjustments.</p>

		<p><strong>RESOLUTION</strong>: The easiest way to improve the
		appearance of some graphs is to increase the resolution. The default
		resolution is 21 by 21 by 21 for implicit graphs, and 40 by 40 for
		parametric surfaces. To change the resolution for implicit graphs, use
		the <strong>EDIT</strong> dialog box to insert a line such as the
		following before the <strong>GRAPH3D</strong> command:
	<ul>
		<li>graph3d.resolution := 30</li>
	</ul>
	
		<p><strong>For parametric surfaces:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>graph3d.stepu := 50</li>
		<li>graph3d.stepsv := 50</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
		You may find it useful to use the technique described in the previous
		section on <strong>DEFAULTS.DPG</strong>

		<p><strong>COPYING A GRAPH TO THE CLIPBOARD:</strong> Click on
		<strong>CLIPBOARD</strong> to copy a picture of the graph to the
		clipboard. To copy a picture of the entire window (including the
		border, etc.) to the clipboard, simultaneously press down the
		<strong>ALT</strong> and <strong>PRINTSCREEN</strong> keys. To copy a
		picture of the whole screen to the clipboard, press
		<strong>PRINTSCREEN.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>COPYING A GRAPH INTO ANOTHER APPLICATION:</strong> If the
		other application supports pasting, first copy the graph to the
		clipboard. Then click on <strong>EDIT</strong> in the other
		application, then click on <strong>PASTE.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>PRINTING A GRAPH:</strong> First copy the the graph to an
		application, such as Word or Paint, that supports printing. Then click
		on <strong>FILE</strong> in the other application, then click on
		<strong>PRINT.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>FILE FORMAT:</strong> DPGraph files have a file type of
		.DPG. There are two kinds of DPG files: binary and ASCII. DPGraph can
		read and write either type of DPG file, but the DPGraph Viewer can
		only read binary DPG files. Binary DPG files are compressed and
		contain error detection information for more reliable transmission.
		<strong>ASCII DPG</strong> files are readable and editable by Notepad
		and many other text editors. Each line in the file is a separate
		command for DPGraph. For example, a file might look like this:
	<ul>
		<li>graph3d.view:=top</li>
		<li>graph3d.perspective:=false</li>
		<li>graph3d(z=3*sin(x*y))</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
		Each command must start on a separate line. The GRAPH3D command must
		be the last command.
	
		<p><strong>UNINSTALLATION:</strong> There are two ways to remove
		DPGraph from your hard disk drive.
	<ul>
		<li>Method 1: click on <strong>START - SETTINGS - CONTROL PANEL -
		ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS,</strong> then scroll to DPGraph in the window,
		select it, and click on <strong>ADD/REMOVE.</strong></li>
		<li>Method 2: click on <strong>START - PROGRAMS - DPGRAPH -
		UNINSTALL.</strong></li>
	</ul>

		<p>Down below are a few examples of art created using the DPGraph Editor! The images are all varied, which makes sense since unless you're copying something, it's hard to get a perfect replication of something someone else has made, which makes each and every project created unique. There's so much you can do with DPGraph, and these still images aren't the only things! You can also make fun and cool GIFS as well, though just make sure it doesn't blind yourself!</p></a>

		<img src="images/enneper.jpg" alt="enneper">	
		<p>This is a strange project, as it makes you wonder, are you seeing a tunnel, a skateboard ramp, a strange chimney, or a 'Bone Breaking Simulator' map on Roblox</p>
		<img src="images/seashell.jpg" class="r" alt="seashell">
		<p>This image is quite nice, using a good color variation and design to make a unique shape of a seashell. The colors and shading help it look more realistic, though one does wonder how sound would work since the sound would go right back into where it comes out</p>
		<img src="images/func.jpg" alt="func">
		<p>The design is unique on this picture, and it either looks like a fountain sprouting up some water, or a mutant creature coming out of a portal. Either way, pretty cool!</p>
		<img src="images/diamant2.jpg" class="r" alt="diament">
		<p>This one is quite interesting. A diamond that has eaten a bunch of crayons, thrown them up in a bucket, then took a shower in the remains. Okay aside from the coloring, the actual design is quite nice, and it does look like a real diamond you'd see in a cartoon</p>
