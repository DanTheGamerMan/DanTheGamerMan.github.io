<h3>Weapons and armour</h3>
<p>The armour and weapons in the game are extremely diverse, and
different weapons and armour do different damage and defence. There
are different types of each, in armour, there’s light and heavy, in
weapons there’s one-handed and two-handed. Each will take more time to
swing, nullify your ability to run, or just be a hindrance, but if you
like heavy armour, as it is more protecting, then by all means use it.
The weapons are the same. If you like a big crushing impact on your
enemy, then use two-handed weapons. This website isn’t here to tell
you what to do and what not to do, but rather to suggest possible
weapons. </p>

<h3>Creating Weapons and Armour</h3>
<p>As said before, there are hundreds of different weapons and armour
in Skyrim, different in the fact that they can be enchanted or made of
different materials, or even just found in caves. The way you can make
them is you go to a blacksmith in any of the Holds, and start
smithing. After you make armour, you can improve it at a workbench or
a grindstone. Improving the item will make it either more powerful or
more defensive, and will really help in any battle. The Skill Tree is
an important part to smithing, since without the smithing skills you
can't smith any type of armour or weapon, and while the skill tree
might appear to be a circle, it is really two separate paths, both
ending at Dragon Armor, which allows creation of the best light armor
(Dragonscale) and second-best heavy armor (Dragonplate). The left-hand
branch is shorter, requiring one fewer perk than the right-hand branch
to reach Dragon armor. Since the left-hand branch includes
medium-quality heavy armor (steel plate, via the Advanced Armors
perk), the left-hand branch can also be a good choice for heavy armor
specialists. Also note that he difference in armor rating between
Dragonplate and the best heavy armor, Daedric, is not necessarily
significant. The lighter weight of Dragonplate armor may be of more
importance, unless you have either the Conditioning perk or activate
The Steed Stone, both of which negate the adverse effects of heavy
weight. Both ebony and Daedric weapons are better than glass ones,
which is the best type offered by the left-hand branch. However, when
upgraded to Legendary quality, the damage difference between a glass
weapon and a Daedric one will be less than 10%</p>

<aside id="a1">Enemies will gradually begin to match your level, but
not your weapons. This means that if you have daedric armour and
weapons at level 25, you're a couple of steps ahead of the
game</aside>
<aside id="a2">You will be able to harvest dragon souls when you kill
dragons and use the souls to unlock shouts in certain quests or caves
where you gain the word to a shout, and you use the soul to unlock
it</aside>
<aside id="a3">When smithing, you should wear smithing-boosting
armour, as well as maybe using a potion of smithing for the BEST
results</aside>
