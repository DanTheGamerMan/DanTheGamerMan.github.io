<h3>Basic Knowledge Of The Game</h3>
<p>Skyrim is a fantasy game, arguably based upon Norse Mythology and
heritage, which starts you off as a prisoner on his way to an
execution. You are in a cart with three other prisoners, and as you go
towards the chopping block one of the prisoners explains the essence
of the game and the reason each man is there. One of the other
prisoners, Ulfric Stormcloak, is actually a Jarl of the Hold Windhelm,
and will appear many times later in the game, in an optional mission
to assist the Stormcloak rebellion against the Imperial legion. When
you get down to the chopping block, you decide your character's name
and race, both of which are completely up to you. The prisoner in
front of you is executed, and then you are set to be next, but before
you can be executed, a dragon attacks where you're being held, and you
are able to escape. From there, the journey is yours to behold. From
monsterous spiders in caves to bandit camps next to Holds, there's
many enemies and adventures to explore and discover in Skyrim, and
this website is to help you gain a foothold on your game. With nine
holds, countless missions, endless activites, and many mods that can
bring in additional features such as a whole new province named
Solstheim, or smaller mods like adoption, Skyrim is an interactive,
intriguing and quite frankly an addicting game, and I hope that this
website will help you enjoy the game as much as I did.</p>

<h3>The Nine Holds</h3>
<p>In Skyrim, kingdoms and territories are marked by citadels named
<strong>Holds</strong>. There are nine Holds in Skyrim;</p>
<ul>
<li>Falkreath</li>
<li>Whiterun</li>
<li>Morthal</li>
<li>Dawnstar</li>
<li>Winterhold</li>
<li>Solitude</li>
<li>Riften</li>
<li>Markarth</li>
<li>Windhelm</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these holds will have either Stormcloak or Imperial guards,
or maybe even High Elves. The guard type in a city can change
depending on if you join the war and which side you take in it. Each
hold will have a house they can give you, or in some holds
(Hjaalmarch, Falkreath and The Pale) you can build a house, by
purchasing land from the steward or Jarl of these holds. Each hold has
a capital, which will be where you find the Jarl and steward and
such.</p>

for Windows, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3</aside>
<aside id="a2">The Dragonborn addition to the game wasn't actually in
the first release of Skyrim, and was the final add-on by the
developers for Skyrim</aside>
<aside id="a3">As you move on in the game, you will find that
different locations will have different logos on your map, and you
will eventually gain the memory and skill to differentiate
them</aside>
