<h3>Use of potions</h3>
<p>There's a lot of potions out there, many of them do different
things but as it stands here, I won't be saying every single potion
there is because that would take until 2030. The different potions
will have different uses, and some potions will be completely useless,
such as the poisons since half the time they don't even do anything
other than annoy the enemies you fight, which late-game tends to be
dragons, giants, mammoths, deathlords and even daedric princes. </p>

<h3>The different potions</h3>
<p>Many different potions are in Skyrim, but here is the list of
potions that will actually come in handy in most situations, along
with whatever you need them for, and of course, how you make them. The
potions that are most useful to sell or use are the ones I've listed
down below, with their creation process, and what they do. Remember
that depending on what Alchemy level you are and what attire you were
wearing when you made the potion, it can sell for a ton, or nothing at
all. As I said before, it's kind of useless to use fear on an enemy
who is used to murdering entire cities and armies alone, cities that
usually have 10-15 guards</p>

<aside id="a1">The only real use for any of the poison potions will be
to sell, since at a high level you can create potions that will sell
for tens of thousands of gold.</aside>
<aside id="a2">Potions created by a player will look shabby and kind
of old, but the best potions you can ever get are the ones you
create.</aside>
<aside id="a3">You can and should enchant your spare armour to have
alchemy-boosting enchantments, which can make even your most basic
potions become more valuable than houses.</aside>
